This repository contains a handful of scripts I have created during my career. Most likely they will be made in Python, but expect the unexpected.

> Those scripts are provided as-is and are not guaranteed to work on your machine. However, you open an Issue , drop a line at ahharu@ahharu.com or open a PR and show off your hacker skills
